// Question 1 — Count Number of Edges
// Description

// Write a function that counts how many edges are in an undirected graph.
// The graph is stored as an adjacency matrix. (In this lab, we use an adjacency matrix.)
// Graph* g is a pointer to a Graph struct, which contains a 2D array adj[MAX_NODES][MAX_NODES]. 
// The value at adj[u][v] is 1 if there is an edge between nodes u and v, and 0 otherwise.




int count_edges(Graph* g) {

    int count = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < MAX_NODES; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < MAX_NODES; j++) {
            if (g->adj[i][j] == 1) {
                count++;
            }
        }
    }

    return count / 2;
