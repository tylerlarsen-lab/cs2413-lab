// Description

// Write a function that counts how many nodes are isolated.
// A node is isolated if it has no edges connected to it.
// // The graph is stored as an adjacency matrix. 
// Graph* g is a pointer to a Graph struct, which contains a 2D array adj[MAX_NODES][MAX_NODES]. 
// The value at adj[u][v] is 1 if there is an edge between nodes u and v, and 0 otherwise.
