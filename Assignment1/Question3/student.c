//You are given a large integer represented as an integer array digits, where:

//digits[i] is the i-th digit of the integer
//digits are ordered from most significant to least significant
//there are no leading 0s (except the number 0 itself in some of our tests)
//Goal: Add 1 to the number and return the resulting digits array.

//Example 1:
//Input: digits = [4,3,2,1]
//Output: [4,3,2,2]
//Explanation: The array represents the integer 4321.
//Incrementing by one gives 4321 + 1 = 4322.
//Thus, the result should be [4,3,2,2].

//Example 2:
//Input: digits = [9]
//Output: [1,0]
//Explanation: The array represents the integer 9.
//Incrementing by one gives 9 + 1 = 10.
//Thus, the result should be [1,0].

//Return value (int*): the output digits array.
//Output parameter (returnSize): set *returnSize to the number of digits in the returned array.

int* plusOne(int* digits, int digitsSize, int* returnSize) {
    // TODO: implement
