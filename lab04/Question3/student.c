Question 3: Sum Root to Leaf Numbers

You are given the root of a binary tree containing digits from 0 to 9 only.

Each root-to-leaf path represents a number.
For example, the root-to-leaf path 1 -> 2 -> 3 represents the number 123.

Return the total sum of all root-to-leaf numbers.

A leaf node is a node with no children.

Examples:

Example 1:
Input:
        1
       / \
      2   3
Output: 25
Explanation:
The root-to-leaf path 1->2 represents 12.
The root-to-leaf path 1->3 represents 13.
12 + 13 = 25.

Example 2:
Input:
          4
         / \
        9   0
       / \
      5   1
Output: 1026
Explanation:
The numbers are 495, 491, and 40.
495 + 491 + 40 = 1026.

Function to complete:
    int sumNumbers(struct TreeNode* root);

Note:
- Each node stores a digit from 0 to 9.
- If the tree is empty, return 0.
- Build the current number as you move from root to leaf.
